# Itchy v0.1
# A menu system for Adafruit LCDs (PID 181)
I was looking around on GitHub for a menu system for Adafruit LCDs. All the ones I found were for
the Adafruit Pi Plate, not the plain LCD I have. So, I made Itchy.

Note: I do not have my LCD yet so I cannot test this.
Another note: I do not know how to sense key presses in Python, so this code will not work when you run it.
